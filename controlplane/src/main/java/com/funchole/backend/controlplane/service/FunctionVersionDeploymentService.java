/**
 * Orchestrates the full source-to-deployed-artifact pipeline for a
 * FunctionVersion and drives its deployment lifecycle:
 *
 * <pre>
 * DRAFT -&gt; PUBLISHING -&gt; BuildWorkspaceService.prepareWorkspace(...)
 *                     -&gt; RuntimeBuilderRegistry.resolve(...) -&gt; RuntimeBuilder.build(...)
 *                     -&gt; ArtifactPublisher.publish(...)
 *                     -&gt; FunctionVersionArtifactRegistry.attachPublishedArtifact(...)
 *                     -&gt; READY
 *                     \-&gt; (any failure above) -&gt;----------------------------------&gt; FAILED
 * </pre>
 *
 * This class holds no build logic itself - it only sequences its
 * collaborators and validates the hand-offs between them: source
 * materialization stays in {@link BuildWorkspaceService}, runtime-specific
 * building stays entirely behind {@link RuntimeBuilder} (selected via
 * {@link RuntimeBuilderRegistry} from the FunctionVersion's own declared
 * runtime - never hardcoded), packaging/checksum/upload stays in
 * {@link ArtifactPublisher}, and the final atomic deployment finalization
 * (artifact metadata persistence + PUBLISHING -&gt; READY transition) stays in
 * {@link FunctionVersionDeploymentFinalizer}.
 *
 * <p>{@link BuildWorkspace} and {@link PreparedArtifact} are both
 * {@code AutoCloseable}; nesting them in try-with-resources guarantees both
 * are cleaned up whether the build/publish sequence succeeds or fails.
 *
 * <p>Once {@link ArtifactPublisher#publish} has returned successfully, the
 * remote artifact exists whether or not the atomic finalization that follows
 * it commits. A failed finalization persists nothing locally, so the
 * published artifact is compensated (deleted, best-effort) with the original
 * finalization failure preserved as the primary cause and any compensation
 * failure added as suppressed. A failure in {@code publish} itself is
 * never compensated - there is no {@code PublishedArtifact} to reference,
 * and the existing orphan-on-write-failure gap documented for the artifact
 * registry remains an accepted limitation. A COMMITTED finalization is
 * terminal: compensation never runs for a successfully finalized READY
 * deployment. */
